          Why I Love My Favorite God?

Not favorite, I'm a very big fan of'Lord GANESHA'.Yup,I just love him.I love his sparkling eyes,he is adventurous and a happy wonder kid.Ganesh myths are full of humor and good natured adventure,often revealing deeper meaning.I particularly love the story where he is competing with his brother Lord Karthikeya to see who can race around the world the fastest.Both would get along well but,just like all other siblings,they would have moments of arguments and fights.Once it happened that devas gave one divine fruit to Lord Shiva and Ma Parvati and told them that it is a special fruit.Whoever will eat it,will get the supreme knowledge and immortality.Both Ganesha and Karthikeya wanted to eat it.So this lead to an argument between them.To choose who gets it, Lord Shiva proposed a challenge.He told Ganesha and Karthikeya that whoever will circle the world three times and come back first will get the fruit.While his brother Karthikeya sets out to cover the world,Ganesha started walking around Shiva and Parvati and completed three circles around them.When asked by Lord Shiva and Ma Parvathi,Ganesha replied that Lord Shiva had asked them to circle the world.And for him,his parents were more than the world.They were the entire universe.Saying that Lord Shiva and Ma Parvathi was touched and impressed by Ganesha’s wisdom and saw him as the rightful owner of the fruit.This story shows he's a symbol for intelligent,out of the box thinking.To me this story not only gives a great example of how using our wisdom can help resolve a situation smartly,but it also teaches that our parents should be given the respect and love they deserve.On a deeper level Ganesh symbolizes high achievement,a quest for knowledge and the value of hard work,the never give up spirit.He is a well rounded example of how to live an enriched life.And most of all,Ganesha is the god of ‘moving away obstacles'and the god of 'new beginnings'.
